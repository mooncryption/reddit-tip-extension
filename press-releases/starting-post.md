## Introducing: the Reddit Tip Extension
After the success of u/rawb0t's amazing **tippr** bot, I wanted to make an interface to make using tippr _even_ easier than it already is.

#### Installation
See [this link](https://mooncryption.github.io/reddit-tip-extension/#installation) for a handy guide on how to install it.

The link in the Chrome Webstore is [here]().

#### Description
Here are some of the bullet points for the Reddit Tip Extension:

* tip anyone easily in BCH, bits, or USD (with real-time unit conversions) on Reddit
* gild any post through `tippr` easily
* manage default tips and settings to make tipping even easier
* deposit BCH, check your `tippr` balance, and withdraw BCH easily
* combine tipping _into the normal reddit interface_

I'm especially proud of the last one because the extension adds a simple `give tip` button on all posts and comments, _just like_ the `give gold` one. It blends in easily with the Reddit interface:

But that's not all. You can deposit, withdraw, gild, and more. Let's look at gilding, for example:

**Why should you trust the extension?** This is a very good question to ask, and it's important to be paranoid about your security.

* The extension is _fully open-source_. [Github Repository Here](https://github.com/mooncryption/reddit-tip-extension); I'm happy to accept useful pull requests and contributions.
* You can verify that the extension code isn't harmful, by [following this tutorial](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14543896/where-does-chrome-store-extensions) on how to find the source code of any extension on your hard drive. After that, you can easily look through the code and make sure the raw code files match the open-source version.
* The extension only has permissions for Reddit.com sites. It doesn't even interface with the Reddit API so you don't really have to 'trust' it.
* Though I can update the extension with new source code, all of the code will be off the open-source version, and you can easily follow the second bullet point in this list to verify that the source code is non-harmful.

**I need help with bug testers!** I've vetted the extension pretty thoroughly on the latest version of Google Chrome on macOS but I don't have access to many other operating systems or means to test. If you want to help out, all it takes is installing the extension, trying it out (maybe even on this post ðŸ˜‚), and clicking the `Report a Bug` button on the main dashboard whenever you feel like giving feedback.

I promise to read and reply to _all_ of the feedback I get. The `Report a Bug` link simply takes you to Reddit's Private Messages where you can message me directly with your feedback and observations.

### In The Future...
In the future, there are many possibilities for new features and where the extension can go. If you have ideas, I would love to hear them. If you're a developer who's into this kind of stuff, I would love your help. 

**note:** I'm not affiliated with `tippr` in any way, but this extension relies heavily on them for what they do. Thanks u/tippr! 

**note 2:** The official website for the extension is [here](https://mooncryption.github.io/reddit-tip-extension), and it has animations, screenshots, and easy documentation for how to use it!
