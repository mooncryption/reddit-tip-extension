**Reddit Tip Extension** is a browser extension that works with /u/tippr on Reddit to tip posts/comments in BCH!

It's being tested on the latest version of Chrome and Opera, though you may try it on other browsers as well.

For everything from **how to install** to **how to use**, see [the extension website](http://mooncryption.github.io/reddit-tip-extension). Thanks!
