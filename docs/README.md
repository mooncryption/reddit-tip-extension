1. Click the button above to start downloading and installing the extension. Make sure you're on a supported browser, such as Google Chrome or Opera.
2. That's it! Go to any Reddit subreddit in a new tab, and start clicking those `give tip` buttons!

## Usage
0. First, you'll need to get a deposit in! Message the word `deposit` to `/u/tippr` on Reddit to do this. After that, get tipping! See below for instructions.

2. If you want to use it so it only _fills_ the comment, and doesn't auto-submit it, go to [`about:extensions`](about:extensions), then scroll to the Reddit Tip Extension. Click 'Options', then change the tipping mode to the second option.

After that, use it like so:
